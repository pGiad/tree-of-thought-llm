The numbers are: 5, 6, 6, and 8.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. 8 + 6 = 14 (left: 5, 6, 14)\n2. 6 - 5 = 1 (left: 1, 14)\n3. 14 * 1 = 14 (left: 14)\n4. 14 + 5 = 19 (left: 6, 19)\n5. 19 + 6 = 25 (oops, too big!)\n6. Wait a minute... What about 8 - 6 = 2? (left: 2, 5, 19)\n7. 19 / 2 = 9.5 (too small!)\n8. Hmm... How about 5 * 2 = 10? (left: 8, 10)\n9. 10 + 8 = 18 (left: 18)\n10. 18 + 6 = 24 (voil\u00e0!)\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(8 - 6) + ((5 * 2) + 8) = 24\n\nPhew! That was a long one. Did I get it right?"
